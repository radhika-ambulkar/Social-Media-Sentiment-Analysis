# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis
This is my Third internship project at Next24tech Technology and Services. This project deals with the Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis using data analytics and ML algorithm.
This is the sentiment140 dataset.
It contains 1,600,000 tweets extracted using the twitter api . The tweets have been annotated (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive) and they can be used to detect sentiment .
It contains the following 6 fields:

target: the polarity of the tweet (0 = negative, 2 = neutral, 4 = positive)
ids: The id of the tweet ( 2087)
date: the date of the tweet (Sat May 16 23:58:44 UTC 2009)
flag: The query (lyx). If there is no query, then this value is NO_QUERY.
user: the user that tweeted (robotickilldozr)
text: the text of the tweet (Lyx is cool)
